# openheard MCP Server

The MCP server exposes the same capabilities as the REST API as [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools. Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can manage your feedback board conversationally.

**Endpoint:** `/api/mcp`
**Transport:** Streamable HTTP (stateless)
**Auth:** Same `Bearer` API key as the REST API

## Connectivity probe

A plain authenticated `GET /api/mcp` (no `Accept: text/event-stream`) returns
`200 application/json` with server info instead of the transport's `406`:

```bash
curl -s https://your-domain.com/api/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer oh_your_key_here"
# {"name":"openheard","version":"0.1.0","transport":"streamable-http","tools":[...],"docs":"..."}
```

Agent hosts that test a connector with a bare GET before speaking JSON-RPC
(Muse custom connectors, uptime checks) treat any non-2xx as "failed to
connect"; this is the answer they need. A missing or unknown key is still `401`
and the rate limit still applies. A GET that does accept `text/event-stream`
opens the SDK's SSE stream as before; `POST` and `DELETE` are unchanged.

## Rate limits

The MCP endpoint is rate-limited to **60 requests per minute** per API key (or per IP if no key is provided). Exceeding the limit returns HTTP `429` with a `Retry-After` header indicating seconds until the window resets.

## Setup

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add openheard \
  --transport http \
  "https://your-domain.com/api/mcp" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer oh_your_key_here"
```

Or add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openheard": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-domain.com/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer oh_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

In Cursor settings → MCP Servers, add:

```json
{
  "openheard": {
    "url": "https://your-domain.com/api/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer oh_your_key_here"
    }
  }
}
```

### Local dev

```bash
# Generate a key
OPENHEARD_LOCAL=1 bun run apps/web/src/scripts/make-api-key.ts

# Point at local
claude mcp add openheard-local \
  --transport http \
  "http://localhost:3001/api/mcp" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer oh_your_key_here"
```

## Example conversation

> **You:** Show me the top 5 most-voted posts
>
> **Claude:** *(calls list_posts with sort=top, limit=5)*
>
> Here are your top posts: ...

> **You:** Move post #3 to planned
>
> **Claude:** *(calls set_status with post_id=3, status=planned)*
>
> Done — post #3 is now "Planned".

## Runtime compatibility

The MCP server uses the Web Standards Streamable HTTP transport (`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`). It runs on:

- Cloudflare Workers (production)
- Local dev with Bun/Node (OPENHEARD_LOCAL=1)
- Any runtime supporting the Fetch API
