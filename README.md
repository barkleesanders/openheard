## Why

Collecting feedback should not cost $79 a month or a weekend of Docker.
Every open source feedback tool needs a VPS, Postgres and someone to babysit
it, and most of them look like an admin template.

openheard is one Cloudflare Worker and one D1 database. It deploys in two
commands, runs on the free tier, and is designed like a product people would
pay for. Self-hosting is the default, not the afterthought.

## Features

**Collect**
- Public board with voting, search, sorting and keyboard navigation
- Posts with comments, reactions and a status timeline
- Anonymous voting, sign-in gate on posting, optional approval queue
- Sign in with Google, magic link or password

**Manage**
- Dashboard with inbox, internal notes, merge, pin, tags and ETA
- Custom statuses that drive the roadmap columns
- Team invites, admin and member roles, join links
- Import from a CSV export of Canny or similar tools; export to JSON and CSV

**Publish**
- Roadmap with drag between columns
- Changelog with an editor, linked shipped posts and an RSS feed
- Branding: accent colour pulled from your website, board name

**Extend**
- HTTP API with per-workspace keys at `/api/v1` ([docs](docs/api.md))
- MCP server at `/api/mcp` so Claude, Cursor and other agents can read and
  triage feedback ([docs](docs/mcp.md))
- Multi-workspace: each workspace lives on its own subdomain

Coming next: image uploads, changelog email subscribers, an embeddable widget,
a CLI and a docs site.

## Get started

### Cloud

Sign up at [openheard.com](https://openheard.com). Your board lives at
`<slug>.openheard.com`. There is a free tier.

### Self-host on Cloudflare

Needs a Cloudflare account. Everything fits in the free tier.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heilonng23/openheard && cd openheard
bun install
cp packages/infra/.env.example packages/infra/.env   # set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy login --configure && cd ../..
bun run deploy
```

That provisions the Worker, the D1 database and KV, applies migrations and
prints your URL. The first account to sign up becomes the admin.

### Run locally

No Cloudflare account needed. A SQLite file stands in for D1.

```bash
bun install
bun run db:push:local   # creates apps/web/local.db
bun run dev:local       # http://localhost:3001
bun run db:seed         # optional demo posts
```

Keyboard on the board: `j` `k` move, `v` vote, `enter` open, `/` search,
`c` new post.

## Fork notice (AGPL-3.0 section 13)

`github.com/barkleesanders/openheard` is a modified fork of
[Heilonng23/openheard](https://github.com/Heilonng23/openheard), run as a
network service for three sites: feedback.aivaclaims.com,
feedback.improvebayarea.com and feedback.improvecortland.com. The complete
corresponding source of the version in service is this repository; the
modifications are `git log upstream/main..HEAD` (with
`upstream = https://github.com/Heilonng23/openheard`) and are described in
[docs/self-host-improve-network.md](docs/self-host-improve-network.md).
Upstream authorship, copyright and licence are unchanged.

## License

The app (`apps/web`, `packages/db`, `packages/auth`, `packages/ui`) is
[AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). Self-host it freely; if you run a modified version as a
service, publish your changes.

The pieces you embed in your own product, the widget, the CLI and the API
client, will ship under MIT in their own packages so they never touch your
licence.
